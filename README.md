# Neural-Network-Model-For-Classifying-Wine
A built-from-scratch Neural Network model by Hoang Minh Thai for classifying 3 different types of Wine based on 13 typical features of Wines in the given dataset.

The given dataset contains approximately 180 examples with each one having 13 features.

The model built has 3 hidden layers and each layer has approximately 20 neurons (due to the characteristics of the dataset) for efficient classifying task.

Furthermore, PCA and other data pre-processing methods such as utilizing Pandas library to reformat the dataset are also applied in the source code to pre-process data.

The chosen learning rate and number of epochs could be adjusted.

The result after training: The model achieving a nearly absolute accuracy with more than 98,3%.
