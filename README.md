# Neural-Network-Model-For-Classifying-Wine
A built-from-scratch Neural Network model by Hoang Minh Thai for classifying 3 different types of Wine based on 13 typical features in the given dataset.

The model built has 2 hidden layers and each layer has approximately 30 neurons for the efficient classifying task.

Furthermore, PCA and other data pre-processing methods are also applied in the source code to pre-process data.

The result after training:
