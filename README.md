# Neural-Network-Model-For-Classifying-Wine
A built-from-scratch Neural Network model by Hoang Minh Thai for classifying 3 different types of Wine based on 13 typical features of Wines in the given dataset.

The given dataset contains approximately 180 examples with each one having 13 features.

The built-from-scratch model has 3 hidden layers and each layer has approximately 20 neurons (due to the characteristics of the dataset) for efficient classifying task.

Furthermore, PCA and other data pre-processing methods such as utilizing Pandas library to reformat the dataset are also applied in the source code to pre-process data.

The chosen learning rate and number of epochs could be adjusted.

The result after training: 

The model achieving a nearly absolute accuracy with more than 98,5% for the training set and approximately 97,2% for the testing one.
